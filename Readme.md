# Welcome to My Weather App

- Create a rapid api account and copy your key credentials (the api I use is free for the first 100 requests)
- post the key in the "apiCredentials.json" file right after "apiKey:"
    - such as "apiKey:"  `your key here`
- Start the server with "node server" in the topmost directory.
- Type in the latitude and longitude in the appropriate text fields.
    -	make sure you use negative lat and lons when appropriate
    -	for example, Worcester, MA GPS coord is 42 deg N and 71 deg W so the latitude and longitude is 42.26 and **-71.80**
